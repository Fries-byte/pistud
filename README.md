## ðŸŒŸ What is Pust?

Pust is a new systems-level programming language inspired by Rust.  
Our goal is to offer powerful, safe, and concurrent programming capabilities with an easier learning curve.  
Think **Rust**, but with **Pust** simplicity and elegance!

## âœ¨ Features (Work in Progress)

- **Easy to use**: Pust is easy to use, like, pln, iln, fn and cv!

## ðŸ›  Getting Started
Download [python](https://python.org) before crossing the line!
ðŸš§ The language is in its early stages. ðŸš§  
However, if you're curious and would like to experiment:

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pust-Lang/Pust
   ```
2. Run the files
   Run and open the file named 'main.py', you'll be seeing "p.fn("main", [""]). In between the [""] is where you code
   To learn Pust, go in our website and click on "cource"

Have fun!
