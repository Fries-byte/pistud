## What is PiStud?

PiStud is a new low-level programming language inspired by Rust.  
Our goal is to offer powerful, safe, and concurrent programming capabilities with an easier learning curve.  
Think **Rust**, but with **PiStud** simplicity and elegance!

## Features (Work in Progress)

- **Easy to use**: Pust is easy to use, like, pln, iln, fn, wo, if_stmt and cv!
- **Usefull**: Pust is written it so that its easy to code for bigginers, it might also be usefull
- **Software**: Building software is slowly being implemented, and you can create windows and message boxes

## Useful Info
**Importing Functions**: To import a function, use python's import system. ```import file``` thats it, run the function with ```fn("funcname")``` <br> <br>

## Getting Started
Download [python](https://python.org) before downloading! <br>
Clone with git: <br>

Clone the repository: <br> <br>
  
  Clone ide (Recommended):
   <br> <br>
   
   ```bash
   https://github.com/PiStud-Lang/main.pistud
   ```

  <br>
  clone repo:
  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PiStud-Lang/pistud
   ```
   
   
   <br><br>
3. Run the files <br>
   Run and open the file named 'main.py', you'll be seeing "ps.fn("main", """"""). In between the """""" is where you code, you may also not use Mainspace, but you need to add ps. , like this: ps.pln("Hello World!") <br>
