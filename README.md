  <b>Pust</b> â€“ A Rust-inspired programming language  
  This program is in pre-release. The full code is still under development.

## What is Pust?

Pust is a new low-level programming language inspired by Rust.  
Our goal is to offer powerful, safe, and concurrent programming capabilities with an easier learning curve.  
Think **Rust**, but with **Pust** simplicity and elegance!

---

## Features (Work in Progress)

- **Easy to use**: Pust is easy to use, like, pln, iln, fn and cv!

---
## How to program
- **Mainspace**: Mainspace is where you can code without using the p. , like this: p.fn("main", ['pln("my coding space")'])
- **Print**: To print in Pust in use pln("") or p.pln("") if it isnt in mainspace
- **Input**: If you want user input, use iln("") or add the p. if not in mainspace
- **Functions**: Currently sometimes functions does not work in Mainspace, so you have to use with p. : p.fn("MyFunc", ['code'])
- **Variables**: Variables, this is a long one. to create a variable, use cv("VariableName", "Value"), to print or Input a variable, use pln("VariableName") and input, if its outside of Mainspace use variable = p.iln("Type Hello: ") like in basic python.


## Getting Started
Download [python](https://python.org) before crossing the line! <br>
ðŸš§ The language is in its early stages. ðŸš§  <br>
However, if you're curious and would like to experiment: <br>

1. Clone the repository: <br>  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pust-Lang/Pust
   ```
2. Run the files <br>
   Run and open the file named 'main.py', you'll be seeing "p.fn("main", [""]). In between the [""] is where you code <br>
   To learn Pust, go in our website and click on "cource" (still in development!) <br>

Have fun!
