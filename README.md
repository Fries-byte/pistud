## pistud
A programming language inspired by Rust build to make it easy to program with the usefulness it needs, <br>
its one of my projects that makes me program since i was bored, and you can try it out yourself in **Get started** section

## About the language
Pistud is not only easy to use, you can also build fun stuff like an app/software or even create your own language in it! <br>
You also must know that the error log might be bad and so to fix errors are quite hard which what sucks about PiStud

## Getting started
To get started to program PiStud, go in [PiStud's course](https://fries-byte.github.io/pistud/course.html) to learn it first <br>
after you're done with learning it, download [Piargs](https://tinyurl.com/piargs), a package manager for Pistud. <br>
after you've downloaded Piargs use the command ```piargs install pistud``` and it should create a folder with the ide in it. <br>
and you will see the src tab where your main file will be, you can ignore the package.py which what makes you able to code with PiStud, <br>
you can also create more files but make sure that you import the package.py, and to import files (like in python) use python's import system, ```import maintwo.py```. <br>

please read the License and Security if you want the source and all <br> 

Thank you for using PiStud! <br>
