## What is Pust?

Pust is a new low-level programming language inspired by Rust.  
Our goal is to offer powerful, safe, and concurrent programming capabilities with an easier learning curve.  
Think **Rust**, but with **Pust** simplicity and elegance!

## Features (Work in Progress)

- **Easy to use**: Pust is easy to use, like, pln, iln, fn and cv!

   ```
2. Run the files <br>
   Run and open the file named 'main.py', you'll be seeing "p.fn("main", [""]). In between the [""] is where you code <br>
